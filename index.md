<p><strong>Time</strong>: Sat, April 10, 2021 1-2pm PDT</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: Anyone who is passionate about solving problems with data, including middle school students, high school students, college students, and general audience</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The winning team will give a presentation on their winning project LLCUST. Project L.L.O.C.U.S.T. detects and predicts locusts' whereabouts as well as forecasts their movements in vulnerable areas. Using a machine learning model trained on NASA's satellite data of wind, humidity, surface temperatures, and vegetation index, —all of which are factors that promote locust population—the team attunes L.L.O.C.U.S.T. to create a heat map of areas that are most at risk of locust infestation. Through the use of an interactive, AI-powered, user-friendly website, farmers, city-officials, and businesses alike are able to view the model's detection and forecasts in the form of an interactive map.</p>
